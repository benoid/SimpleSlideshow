{"name":"Simpleslideshow","tagline":"Application that creates and displays a slideshow from files in a selected folder","body":"# SimpleSlideshow\r\nA Qt-based application that creates a slideshow and updates in real time \r\nbased on files present in selected folders.  The goal is ease of use\r\nand minimal user interaction, so the user can add and remove slides quickly\r\nwithout needing to halt the slideshow.  \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: This is a pre-release version of the application.  The developer\r\n            is not liable for any damages caused by the use\r\n            or misuse of the application.  Some features may have bugs.\r\n            See TODO.md for an idea of what still needs to be done.\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n- Supports both image and video slides\r\n- Settings panel for easy access to configuration\r\n- Configurable slide display timers\r\n- Ability to sort and randomize slide queue \r\n- Select custom location from which to play slides\r\n- Ability to display and configure informational \r\n  and marketing slides at regular intervals\r\n- Ability to toggle inclusion of sub-folders of slides\r\n  without removing them from local storage\r\n\r\n# To compile\r\n- Check Dependencies - see dependencies_list.md for more info\r\n- run qmake on src/SimpleSlideshow.pro\r\n \r\n# To Use\r\n- Run the application. On startup it will create a profile folder \r\n  called SimpleSlideshow.  Within the profile folder will be a config file \r\n  and a folder called slide_directory.  The application wil look inside \r\n  slide_directory for any subdirectories, and automatically play slides from the \r\n  subdirectories. This allows users to organize slides into campaigns which can be \r\n  turned on and off easily without needing to add and remove files.\r\n- Note: The application does NOT display slides from the root of slide_directory.  \r\n  This is on my todo list to fix.  \r\n\r\n# Supported Formats\r\n\r\nImage\r\n- jpeg\r\n- gif\r\n- bmp\r\n- png\r\n- pbm\r\n- pgm\r\n- ppm\r\n- xbm\r\n\r\nVideo\r\n- ogv\r\n- avi\r\n- mov\r\n- mpg\r\n- mp4\r\n- flv\r\n- wmv\r\n\r\nSlide Format Note: The codecs to display these files are not \r\nbundled with the app.  They must be installed separately. \r\nlibvorbis and gstreamer-plugins-good will cover most\r\nof the open source formats, and qt5-image-format-plugins \r\nis sufficient for the image formats.  \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
